##  Features

-  Motion Detection using OpenCV
-  Object Detection using YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
-  Automatic Snapshots on Detection
-  Email Alerts with Image Attachment
-  Toggle Live Feed On/Off
-  Bootstrap-based Responsive Web Interface

## Why This Project?
Security and surveillance systems are becoming increasingly important in both residential and commercial spaces. This project combines computer vision, AI object detection, and Flask web development to simulate a real-world smart surveillance camera system. It serves as a hands-on implementation of:

Motion detection algorithms
YOLOv8 AI-based object recognition
Live video streaming via Flask
Email alerts for intrusions
Frontend UX design with Bootstrap

This project was built to demostrate my ability to integrate AI models with Computer Vision and develop a full-stack solution that is responsive, interactive and valuable.
